	abstract = {R5py is a Python library for rapid realistic routing on multimodal transport networks (walk, bike, public transport and car). It provides a simple and friendly interface to R5, the Rapid Realistic Routing on Real-world and Reimagined networks, the routing engine developed by Conveyal. r5py is inspired by r5r, a wrapper for R, and the library is designed to interact with {GeoPandas} {GeoDataFrames}. R5py offers a simple way to run R5 locally with Python, allowing the users to calculate travel time matrices and accessibility by different travel modes. To get started, see a detailed demonstration of the r5py in action from the Usage -section. Over time, r5py will be expanded to incorporate other functionalities from R5.},
