abstract: <p align="justify"> R5py is a Python library for rapid realistic routing on multimodal transport networks (walk, bike, public transport and car). It provides a simple and friendly interface to R5, the Rapid Realistic Routing on Real-world and Reimagined networks, the routing engine developed by Conveyal. r5py is inspired by r5r, a wrapper for R, and it is designed to interact with GeoPandas GeoDataFrames. </p>
