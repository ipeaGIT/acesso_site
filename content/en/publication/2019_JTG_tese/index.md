title: "Future accessibility impacts of transport policy scenarios: Equity and sensitivity to travel time thresholds for Bus Rapid Transit expansion in Rio de Janeiro"


abstract: <p align="justify"> The accessibility impacts of transport projects ex-post implementation are generally evaluated using cumulative opportunity measures based on a single travel time threshold. Fewer studies have explored how accessibility appraisal of transport plans can be used to evaluate policy scenarios and their impacts for different social groups or examined whether the results of project appraisals are sensitive to the time threshold of choice. This paper analyzes how different scenarios of full and partial implementation of the TransBrasil BRT project in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) will likely impact the number of jobs accessible to the population of different income levels. The analysis is conducted under various travel time thresholds of 30, 60, 90 and 120 min to test whether the results are sensitive to the boundary effect of the modifiable temporal unit problem (MTUP). Compared to a partial operation scenario, the full implementation of TransBrasil that extends this corridor into the city center would lead to higher accessibility gains due to network effects of connecting this BRT to other transport modes. Nonetheless, the size of the accessibility impacts of the proposed BRT as well as its distribution across income classes would significantly change depending on the time threshold chosen for the accessibility analysis. Considering cut-off times of 30 or 60 min, both scenarios of TransBrasil would lead to higher accessibility impacts in general and particularly for low-income groups, moving Rio towards a more equitable transportation system. However, under longer thresholds of 90 and 120 min, an evaluation of this project would find much smaller accessibility gains more evenly distributed by income levels. The paper highlights how time threshold choice in cumulative opportunity measures can have important but overlooked implications for policy evaluation and it calls for further research on the MTUP in future transport and mobility studies. </p>

summary: " " # <p align="justify">  This study illustrates how ex-ante accessibility analysis can be used to anticipate the likely accessibility impacts of transportation project scenarios in their early planning stages. The paper evaluates two scenarios of full and partial construction of the TransBrasil BRT corridor, currently under development in Rio de Janeiro. The results suggest that the TransBrasil corridor stands out as a far more equitable investment that promotes larger accessibility gains for lower-income groups when compared to other recent transport investments in Rio. Nonetheless, the size of the accessibility impacts of the proposed BRT as well as its distribution across income classes would significantly change depending on the time threshold chosen for the accessibility analysis. This BRT project would have larger and more progressive accessibility impacts under shorter travel-time thresholds of 30 and 60 minutes, while it would bring smaller and more neutral accessibility gains for longer travel times of 90 and 120 minutes. The results indicate that the conclusion of an equity assessment of transport projects as well as the size of their accessibility impacts can significantly vary depending on the time threshold chosen for the cumulative opportunity accessibility analysis. </p>
