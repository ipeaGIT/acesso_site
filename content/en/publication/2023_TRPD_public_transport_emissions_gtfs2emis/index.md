title: "Estimating public transport emissions from General Transit Feed Specification data"

abstract: <p align="justify"> This paper introduces the gtfs2emis model, a bottom-up method available as an R package to estimate emissions of public transport systems. The method uses General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, a standard format for public transport data widely adopted worldwide, which makes the method easily applicable to cities with limited data. The model requires a GTFS feed of a given transport system and a table with general characteristics of the vehicle fleet profile. The package can estimate over 16 pollutants and energy consumption based on emission factor models from Europe, the United States, and Brazil. It also includes functions to help users examine how emissions are distributed across space, at different times of the day, and by types of vehicles. This paper presents a reproducible example of the city of São Paulo (Brazil) to demonstrate the gtfs2emis package and to discuss the potential applications and limitations of the proposed model.</p>
