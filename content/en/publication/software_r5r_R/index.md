title: "r5r: Rapid realistic routing on multimodal transport networks with R5 in R"

abstract: <p align="justify"> r5r is an R package to conduct rapid realistic routing on multimodal transport networks (walk, bike, public transport and car). It provides a simple and friendly interface to R<sup>5</sup>, what allows users to generate detailed routing analysis or calculate travel time matrices using seamless parallel computing. </p>

Nonetheless, researchers and practitioners often face challenges when performing this task due to long computation times and the cost of licensed software. R{\textasciicircum}5{\textasciicircum} is a multimodal transport network router that offers multiple routing features, such as calculating travel times over a time window and returning multiple itineraries for origin/destination pairs. This paper describes r5r, an open-source R package that leverages R{\textasciicircum}5{\textasciicircum} to efficiently compute travel time matrices and generate detailed itineraries between sets of origins and destinations at no expense using seamless parallel computing.},
