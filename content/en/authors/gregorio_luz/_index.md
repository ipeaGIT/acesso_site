Gregório is a PhD student in City and Regional Planning at the University of California, Berkeley, and a former Research Assistant at the Institute of Applied Economic Research (Ipea). His research focuses on the role of transportation policies in people's lives, emphasizing equity and social exclusion, and the interplay between politics and transportation. He is particularly interested in evaluating public transportation policies, investigating the causal impact of accessibility variations on economic, social, educational, health, and political outcomes. In 2023, his work received the Master's Thesis Award in Transportation Geography from the American Association of Geographers (AAG). 
Between 2022 and 2024, Gregório served as the Director of Transport Planning and Economics at the Belo Horizonte Urban Mobility Superintendence (SUMOB).
