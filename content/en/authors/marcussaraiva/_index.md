Marcus is an urban planner and holds a PhD in Geographic Information Science from Birkbeck, University of London. He currently is a research assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA). His research focuses on inequalities in access to opportunities and spatial segregation in cities, by applying modelling and simulation techniques to urban systems. Marcus is particularly interested in how the use of geotechnologies and geospatial data can improve our understanding of urban issues and provide decision support tools to urban planners and policy-makers.
