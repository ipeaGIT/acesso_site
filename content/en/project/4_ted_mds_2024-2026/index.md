## Partnership with the Ministry of Social Development (2023-2026)

<p align="justify"> 
The partnership with the Ministry of Social Development (MDS) involves conducting a research project to map social protection deserts in Brazil. The research will identify in Brazilian urban areas which neighborhoods and city blocks have low access to Social Assistance Reference Centers (CRAS).

The work will generate actionable data and information that can be used by governmental agencies to assess the challenges of expanding the spatial coverage of Brazil's Unified Registry's for Social Programs, and contribute to the design of actions aimed at improving active search strategies.
