## Project with the Ministry of Cities: (2019-2023)

<p align="justify"> 
The partnership with the Secretariat for Urban Mobility of the Brazilian Ministry of Cities (Semob/Mcid) involves a series of activities conducted by the Ipea team such as:
</p>

- Conducting studies on the urban mobility and accessibility conditions in Brazilian cities
- Generating annual estimates of urban accessibility for Brazilâ€™s largest cities using open access computational scripts and data outputs. These estimates will be used to inform the elaboration of the National Plan of Urban Mobility, as well as to support the National System of Urban Mobility Information (SIMU) and to monitor the effectives of transport policies.
- Organizing seminars and workshops to disseminate this data with local governments, civil society and academic researchers.
- Conducting ex-post studies to assess the accessibility impacts of implemented transport investments, as well as examining ex-ante the future accessibility impacts of transport projects in early planning stages.
- Organizing workshops and trainings targeted to the Semob/Mcid team to enhance their skills on the use of transport accessibility analysis in policy evaluation.
