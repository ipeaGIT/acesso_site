## Project in partnership with Uber (2021-2023)

The partnership with Uber involved research on the complementary and competitive relationships between ride-hailing services and public transportation. The project examined the access to opportunities provided by these services both separately and when used in an integrated way, taking into account the trade-off between monetary costs and travel time.
